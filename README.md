# About
This will enable you to take input from a Leap Motion and output it to an individually addressable RGB LED strip.

The Processing script handles taking in input and sending it over the correct serial port. This script leverages the Leap Motion Processing library.

The Arduino script handles listening to the correct serial port, and sending this data to your individually-addressable RGB LED strip. This script leverages the Adafruit NeoPixel Library.
